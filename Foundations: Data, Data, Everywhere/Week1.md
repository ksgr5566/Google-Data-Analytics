Data science, the discipline of making data useful, is an umbrella term that encompasses three disciplines: ***machine learning, statistics, and analytics***.
These are separated by how many decisions you know you want to make before you begin with them.

If you want to make a few important decisions under uncertainty, that is statistics.
The excellence of statistics is rigor. They are very, very careful about protecting decision-makers from coming to the wrong conclusion.

If you want to automate, in other words, make many, many, many decisions under uncertainty, that is machine learning and AI.
Performance is the excellence of the machine learning and AI engineer. 

But what if you don't know how many decisions you want to make before you begin? What if what you're looking for is inspiration? You want to encounter your unknown unknowns. You want to understand your world. That is analytics.
The excellence of an analyst is speed. How quickly can you surf through vast amounts of data to explore it and discover the gems, the beautiful potential insights that are worth knowing about and bringing to your decision-makers

### Data Ecosystem
An ecosystem is a group of elements that interact with one another.

Data ecosystems are made up of various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data. These elements include hardware and software tools, and the people who use them.

For example, you could tap into your retail store's database, which is an ecosystem filled with customer names, addresses, previous purchases, and customer reviews.

### Data Science
Data science is defined as creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data.

Data **scientists** create new questions using data, while **analysts** find answers to existing questions by creating insights from data sources.

<br />

### Data Analytics
Data analytics in the simplest terms is the science of data.

It's a very broad concept that encompasses everything from the job of managing and using data to the tools and methods that data workers use each and every day.

Data, data analysis and the data ecosystem, all fit under the data analytics umbrella.
