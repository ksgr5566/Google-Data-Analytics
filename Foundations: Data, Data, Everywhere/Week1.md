Data science, the discipline of making data useful, is an umbrella term that encompasses three disciplines: ***machine learning, statistics, and analytics***.
These are separated by how many decisions you know you want to make before you begin with them.

If you want to make a few important decisions under uncertainty, that is statistics.
The excellence of statistics is rigor. They are very, very careful about protecting decision-makers from coming to the wrong conclusion.

If you want to automate, in other words, make many, many, many decisions under uncertainty, that is machine learning and AI.
Performance is the excellence of the machine learning and AI engineer. 

But what if you don't know how many decisions you want to make before you begin? What if what you're looking for is inspiration? You want to encounter your unknown unknowns. You want to understand your world. That is analytics.
The excellence of an analyst is speed. How quickly can you surf through vast amounts of data to explore it and discover the gems, the beautiful potential insights that are worth knowing about and bringing to your decision-makers
