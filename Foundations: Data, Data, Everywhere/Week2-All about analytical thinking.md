### Analytical Thinking
Analytical thinking involves identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner.

Five key aspects to analytical thinking:
1. Visualization 
   - The graphical representation of information.
   - To understand and explain information more effectively.
2. Strategy 
   - Strategizing helps data analysts see what they want to achieve with the data and how they can get there. Strategy also helps improve the quality and usefulness of the data we collect. By strategizing, we know all our data is valuable and can help us accomplish our goals.
3. Problem-orientation 
   - Data analysts use a problem- oriented approach in order to identify, describe, and solve problems. It's all about keeping the problem top of mind throughout the entire project.
4. Correlation 
   - Being able to identify a correlation between two or more pieces of data.
   - Correlation does not equal causation. In other words, just because two pieces of data are both trending in the same direction, that doesn't necessarily mean they are all related.
5. Big-picture and detail-oriented thinking.
   - Being able to see the big picture as well as the details.
   - Detail-oriented thinking is all about figuring out all of the aspects that will help you execute a plan.
