### Analytical Skills
Analytical skills are qualities and characteristics associated with solving problems using facts.

Five essential aspects to analytical skills:
1. Curiosity  
   - It is all about wanting to learn something. 
2. Understanding context
   - Context is the condition in which something exists or happens. This can be a structure or an environment.
   - Grouping things into categories.
   - Understanding where information fits into the “big picture”.
3. Having technical mindset
   - The ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way.
4. Data design
   - Data design is how you organize information.
5. Data strategy
   - Data strategy is the management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis.

### Analytical Thinking
Analytical thinking involves identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner.

Five key aspects to analytical thinking:
1. Visualization 
   - The graphical representation of information.
   - To understand and explain information more effectively.
2. Strategy 
   - Strategizing helps data analysts see what they want to achieve with the data and how they can get there. Strategy also helps improve the quality and usefulness of the data we collect. By strategizing, we know all our data is valuable and can help us accomplish our goals.
3. Problem-orientation 
   - Data analysts use a problem- oriented approach in order to identify, describe, and solve problems. It's all about keeping the problem top of mind throughout the entire project.
4. Correlation 
   - Being able to identify a relationship between two or more pieces of data.
   - Correlation does not equal causation. In other words, just because two pieces of data are both trending in the same direction, that doesn't necessarily mean they are all related.
5. Big-picture and detail-oriented thinking.
   - Being able to see the big picture as well as the details.
   - Detail-oriented thinking is all about figuring out all of the aspects that will help you execute a plan.

The more ways you can think, the easier it is to think outside the box and come up with fresh ideas.

You need to think **critically** to find out the right questions to ask.

You also need to think **creatively** to get new and unexpected answers.

### Root cause (What is the root cause of a problem?)
A root cause is the reason why a problem occurs.
If we can identify and get rid of a root cause, we can prevent that problem from happening again.

#### 5 whys
In the Five Whys you ask "why" five times to reveal the root cause. The fifth and final answer should give you some useful and sometimes surprising insights.

The Five Whys process is used to reveal a root cause of a problem through the answer to the fifth question.

### Gap analysis (Where are the gaps in our process?)
Gap analysis lets you examine and evaluate how a process works currently in order to get where you want to be in the future.

The general approach to gap analysis is understanding where you are now compared to where you want to be. Then you can identify the gaps that exist between the current and future state and determine how to bridge them.

### (What did we not consider before?)
This is a great way to think about what information or procedure might be missing from a process, so you can identify ways to make better decisions and strategies moving forward.
