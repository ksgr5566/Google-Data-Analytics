### Data life cycle
The entire period of time that data exists in the system.

Six stages of data life cycle:
1. **Plan**: During planning, a business decides what kind of data it needs, how it will be managed throughout its life cycle, who will be responsible for it, and the optimal outcomes.
2. **Capture**: This is where data is collected from a variety of different sources and brought into the organization. 
A **database** is a collection of data stored in a computer system.
3. **Manage**: How we care for our data, how and where it's stored, the tools used to keep it safe and secure, and the actions taken to make sure that it's maintained properly.
4. **Analyze**: In this phase, the data is used to solve problems, make great decisions, and support business goals. A data analyst might use formulas to perform calculations, create a report from the data, or use spreadsheets to aggregate data.
5. **Archive**: Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.
6. **Destroy**: Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data. This is important for protecting a company's private information, as well as private data about its customers.


Individual stages in the data life cycle will vary from company to company or by industry or sector. Although data life cycles vary, one data management principle is universal. Govern how data is handled so that it is accurate, secure, and available to meet your organization's needs.

### Data analyst tools

#### Spreadsheet
A spreadsheet is a digital worksheet. It stores, organizes, and sorts data. This is important because the usefulness of your data depends on how well it's structured. When you put your data into a spreadsheet, you can see patterns, group information and easily find the information you need. Some popular spreadsheets are ***Microsoft Excel*** and ***Google Sheets***. Spreadsheets also have some really useful features called **formulas** and **functions**.
- A **formula** is a set of instructions that performs a specific calculation using the data in a spreadsheet.
- A **function** is a preset command that automatically performs a specific process or task using the data in a spreadsheet.

Spreadsheets structure data in a meaningful way by letting you:
- Collect, store, organize, and sort information
- Identify patterns and piece the data together in a way that works for each specific data project
- Create excellent data visualizations, like graphs and charts. 


#### Query language
A query language is a computer programming language that allows you to retrieve and manipulate data from a database.

SQL is a language that lets data analysts communicate with a database. A database is a collection of data stored in a computer system. With SQL, data analysts can access the data they need by making a query. Some popular Structured Query Language (SQL) programs include MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and BigQuery.

Query languages:
- Allow analysts to isolate specific information from a database(s)
- Make it easier for you to learn and understand the requests made to databases
- Allow analysts to select, create, add, or download data from a database for analysis


#### Data visualization
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information. Some examples include graphs, maps, and tables. They help data analysts communicate their insights to others, in an effective and compelling way. Some popular visualization tools are ***Tableau*** and ***Looker***.

These tools:
- Turn complex numbers into a story that people can understand 
- Help stakeholders come up with conclusions that lead to informed decisions and effective business strategies  
- Have multiple features:
  - Tableau's simple drag-and-drop feature lets users create interactive graphs in dashboards and worksheets. 
  - Looker communicates directly with a database, allowing you to connect your data right to the visual tool you choose.

A career as a data analyst also involves using programming languages, like R and Python, which are used a lot for statistical analysis, visualization, and other data analysis.

- What is the relationship between the data life cycle and the data analysis process? How are the two processes similar? How are they different?
  - The data life cycle involves stages for identifying needs and managing data. Data analysis involves process steps to make meaning from data. 
  - While the data analysis process will drive your projects and help you reach your business goals, you must understand the life cycle of your data in order to use that process. To analyze your data well, you need to have a thorough understanding of it. Similarly, you can collect all the data you want, but the data is only useful to you if you have a plan for analyzing it.

- What is the relationship between the Ask phase of the data analysis process and the Plan phase of the data life cycle? How are they similar? How are they different?
  - The Plan and Ask phases both involve planning and asking questions, but they tackle different subjects. The Ask phase in the data analysis process focuses on big-picture strategic thinking about business goals. However, the Plan phase focuses on the fundamentals of the project, such as what data you have access to, what data you need, and where youâ€™re going to get it.
