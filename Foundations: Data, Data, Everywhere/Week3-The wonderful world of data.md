### Data life cycle
The entire period of time that data exists in the system.

Six stages of data life cycle:
1. **Plan**: During planning, a business decides what kind of data it needs, how it will be managed throughout its life cycle, who will be responsible for it, and the optimal outcomes.
2. **Capture**: This is where data is collected from a variety of different sources and brought into the organization. 
A **database** is a collection of data stored in a computer system.
3. **Manage**: How we care for our data, how and where it's stored, the tools used to keep it safe and secure, and the actions taken to make sure that it's maintained properly.
4. **Analyze**: In this phase, the data is used to solve problems, make great decisions, and support business goals.
5. **Archive**: Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.
6. **Destroy**: Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data. This is important for protecting a company's private information, as well as private data about its customers.


Individual stages in the data life cycle will vary from company to company or by industry or sector. Although data life cycles vary, one data management principle is universal. Govern how data is handled so that it is accurate, secure, and available to meet your organization's needs.
