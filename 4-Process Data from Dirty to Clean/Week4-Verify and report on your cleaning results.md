### Verification
Verification is a process to confirm that a data cleaning effort was well- executed and the resulting data is accurate and reliable. It involves rechecking your clean dataset, doing some manual clean ups if needed, and taking a moment to sit back and really think about the original purpose of the project. That way, you can be confident that the data you collected is credible and appropriate for your purposes.

Reporting is a great opportunity to show stakeholders that you're accountable, build trust with your team, and make sure you're all on the same page of important project details.  Different strategies for reporting include creating **data- cleaning reports**, **documenting your cleaning process**, and using **changelog**.

#### Changelog
A changelog is a file containing a chronologically ordered list of modifications made to a project. It's usually organized by version and includes the date followed by a list of added, improved, and removed features. Changelogs are very useful for keeping track of how a dataset evolved over the course of a project. They're also another great way to communicate and report on data to others.

- The first step in the verification process is going back to your original unclean data set and comparing it to what you have now, review the dirty data and try to identify any common problems.
- Another key part of verification involves taking a big-picture view of your project. This is an opportunity to confirm you're actually focusing on the business problem, that you need to solve, and the overall project goals; and to make sure that your data is actually capable of solving that problem and achieving those goals. Taking a big picture view of your project involves doing three things:
  1. Consider the business problem you're trying to solve with the data. Taking a problem-first approach to analytics is essential at all stages of any project.
  2. Consider the goal of the project. On top of that, you also need to know whether the data you've collected and cleaned will actually help your company achieve that goal.
  3. Consider whether your data is capable of solving the problem and meeting the project objectives.

- **COUNTA** counts the total number of values within a specified range. Note that there's also function called **COUNT**, which only counts the numerical values within a specified range.
- If you're working in SQL, you can address misspellings using a `CASE` statement. The `CASE` statement goes through one or more conditions and returns a value as soon as a condition is met. You should add a CASE statement as a `SELECT` clause. The typo would be a condition and the correction would be the returned value for the condition.
