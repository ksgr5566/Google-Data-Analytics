#### Dirty data and Clean data
Dirty data is data that is incomplete, incorrect, or irrelevant to the problem you're trying to solve. Clean data is data that is complete, correct, and relevant to the problem you're trying to solve.

**Data engineers** transform data into a useful format for analysis and give it a reliable infrastructure. This means they develop, maintain, and test databases, data processors and related systems. <br> **Data warehousing specialists** develop processes and procedures to effectively store and organize data. They make sure that data is available, secure, and backed up to prevent loss.

A **null** is an indication that a value does not exist in a data set.

  <summary>Types of dirty data</summary> <br>
  
Description | Possible Causes | Potential harm to businesses
----------- | --------------- | ----------------------------
<strong>Duplicate data</strong>: Any data record that shows up more than once | Manual data entry, batch data imports, or data migration | Skewed metrics or analyses, inflated or inaccurate counts or predictions, or confusion during data retrieval
<strong>Outdated data</strong>: Any data that is old which should be replaced with newer and more accurate information | People changing roles or companies, or software and systems becoming obsolete | Inaccurate insights, decision-making, and analytics
<strong>Incomplete data</strong>: Any data that is missing important fields | Improper data collection or incorrect data entry | Decreased productivity, inaccurate insights, or inability to complete essential services
<strong>Incorrect/inaccurate data</strong>: Any data that is complete but inaccurate | Human error inserted during data input, fake information, or mock data | Inaccurate insights or decision-making based on bad information resulting in revenue loss
<strong>Inconsistent data</strong>: Any data that uses different formats to represent the same thing | Data stored incorrectly or errors inserted during data transfer | Contradictory data points leading to confusion or inability to classify or segment customers

A **field** is a single piece of information from a row or column of a spreadsheet. **Field length** is a tool for determining how many characters can be keyed into a field. Using the field length tool to specify the number of characters in each cell in the column could be part of data validation.

**Data validation** is a tool for checking the accuracy and quality of data before adding or importing it.

#### Data merging
The process of combining two or more datasets into a single dataset. This presents a unique challenge because when two totally different datasets are combined, the information is almost guaranteed to be inconsistent and misaligned. In data analytics, **compatibility** describes how well two or more datasets are able to work together. 

Key questions to think about to avoid redundancy and to confirm that the datasets are compatible:
- Do I have all the data I need?
- Does the data I need exist within these datasets?
- Do the datasets need to be cleaned, or are they ready for me to use?
- Are the datasets cleaned to the same standard?
