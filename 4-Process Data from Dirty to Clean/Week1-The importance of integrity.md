### Data integrity
The accuracy, completeness, consistency, and trustworthiness of data throughout its lifecycle.

Data integrity can be compromised in lots of different ways. There's a chance data can be compromised every time it's replicated, transferred, or manipulated in any way.
- **Data replication**: The process of storing data in multiple locations. If you're replicating data at different times in different places, there's a chance your data will be out of sync. This data lacks integrity because different people might not be using the same data for their findings, which can cause inconsistencies.
- **Data transfer**: The process of copying data from a storage device to memory, or from one computer to another. If your data transfer is interrupted, you might end up with an incomplete data set, which might not be useful for your needs.
- **Data manipulation**: The process of changing the data to make it more organized and easier to read. Data manipulation is meant to make the data analysis process more efficient, but an error during the process can compromise the efficiency.
- **Other threats**: Data can also be compromised through human error, viruses, malware, hacking, and system failures.
