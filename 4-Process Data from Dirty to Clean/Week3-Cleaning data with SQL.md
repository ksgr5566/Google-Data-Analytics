SQL can process large amounts of data much more quickly than spreadsheets.

Where the data lives will decide which tool you use. If you are working with data that is already in a spreadsheet, that is most likely where you will perform your analysis. And if you are working with data stored in a database, SQL will be the best tool for you to use for your analysis.

Data stored in a SQL database is useful to a project with multiple team members because they can access the data at the same time, use SQL to interact with the database program, and track changes to SQL queries across the team.
