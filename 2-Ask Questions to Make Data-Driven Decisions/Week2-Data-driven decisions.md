The goal of all data analysts is to use data to draw accurate conclusions and make good recommendations. That all starts with having complete, correct, and relevant data. It is possible to have solid data and still make the wrong choices. It is up to data analysts to interpret the data accurately. When data is interpreted incorrectly, it can lead to huge losses. When data is used strategically, businesses can transform and grow their revenue. There is a difference between making a decision with incomplete data and making a decision with a small amount of data. Making a decision with incomplete data is dangerous. But sometimes accurate data from a small test can help you make a good decision.

There are a lot of different kinds of questions that data might help us answer, and these different questions make different kinds of data.

### Quantitative data
Quantitative data is all about the specific and objective measures of numerical facts. This can often be the *what*, *how many*, and *how often* about a problem. In other words, things you can measure, such as a number, quantity or range.

### Qualitative data
Qualitative data is a subjective and explanatory measure of a quality or characteristic. Basically, the things that can't be measured with numerical data, like your hair color. Qualitative data is great for helping us answer *why* questions.

With quantitative data, we can see numbers visualized as charts or graphs. Qualitative data can then give us a more high-level understanding of why the numbers are the way they are. It helps us add context to a problem.

Data analysts will generally use both types of data in their work. Usually, qualitative data can help analysts better understand their quantitative data by providing a reason or more thorough explanation. In other words, quantitative data generally gives you the what, and qualitative data generally gives you the why.
