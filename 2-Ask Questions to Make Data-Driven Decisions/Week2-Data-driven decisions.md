The goal of all data analysts is to use data to draw accurate conclusions and make good recommendations. That all starts with having complete, correct, and relevant data. It is possible to have solid data and still make the wrong choices. It is up to data analysts to interpret the data accurately. When data is interpreted incorrectly, it can lead to huge losses. When data is used strategically, businesses can transform and grow their revenue. There is a difference between making a decision with incomplete data and making a decision with a small amount of data. Making a decision with incomplete data is dangerous. But sometimes accurate data from a small test can help you make a good decision.

There are a lot of different kinds of questions that data might help us answer, and these different questions make different kinds of data.

### Quantitative data
Quantitative data is all about the specific and objective measures of numerical facts. This can often be the *what*, *how many*, and *how often* about a problem. In other words, things you can measure, such as a number, quantity or range.

### Qualitative data
Qualitative data is a subjective and explanatory measure of a quality or characteristic. Basically, the things that can't be measured with numerical data, like your hair color. Qualitative data is great for helping us answer *why* questions.

With quantitative data, we can see numbers visualized as charts or graphs. Qualitative data can then give us a more high-level understanding of why the numbers are the way they are. It helps us add context to a problem.

Data analysts will generally use both types of data in their work. Usually, qualitative data can help analysts better understand their quantitative data by providing a reason or more thorough explanation. In other words, quantitative data generally gives you the what, and qualitative data generally gives you the why.

Two data presentation tools:

### Reports
A report is a static collection of data given to stakeholders periodically. <br> <br>
Pros:
- Reports are great for giving snapshots of **high level historical data** for an organization.
- They can be designed and sent out periodically, often on a weekly or monthly basis, as organized and easy to reference information. They're **quick to design and easy to use** as long as you continually maintain them.
- Since reports use static data or data that doesn't change once it's been recorded, they reflect data that's already been **cleaned and sorted**. <br> 

Cons:
- Reports need **regular maintenance**.
- They are **less visually appealing**.
- Because they aren't automatic or dynamic (**static**), reports don't show live, evolving data. <br> <br>

One way spreadsheet data could be visualized in a report:
#### Pivot Table
A data summarization tool that is used in data processing. Pivot tables are used to summarize, sort, re-organize, group, count, total, or average data stored in a database. It allows its users to transform columns into rows and rows into columns. <br> <br>

### Dashboard
Monitors live, incoming data. A dashboard is a single point of access for managing a business's information. It allows analysts to pull key information from data in a quick review by visualizing the data in a way that makes findings easy to understand.  <br> <br>
Pros:
- **Dynamic, automatic and interactive**: They give your team more access to information being recorded, you can interact through data by playing with filters, and because they're dynamic, they have long-term value.
- **More stakeholder access** and **Low maintenance**: If stakeholders need to continually access information, a dashboard can be more efficient than having to pull reports over and over. <br>

Cons:
- **Labor-intensive design**: They take a lot of time to design and can actually be less efficient than reports, if they're not used very often.
- **Can be confusing**: If the base table breaks at any point, they need a lot of maintenance to get back up and running again.
- **Potentially uncleaned data**: Dashboards can sometimes overwhelm people with information too. If you aren't used to looking through data on a dashboard, you might get lost in it. <br> 

A dashboard would be useful for monitoring data as it becomes available. You might create a Tableau dashboard with interactive graphs that showcase multiple views of the data.

3 most common types of dashboards:
- **Strategic**: focuses on long term goals and strategies at the highest level of metrics
- **Operational**: short-term performance tracking and intermediate goals
- **Analytical**: consists of the datasets and the mathematics used in these sets. hese dashboards contain the details involved in the usage, analysis, and predictions made by data scientists. 

Dashboards identify metrics: Relevant metrics may help analysts assess company performance.

Dashboards can help companies perform many helpful tasks, such as:
- Track historical and current performance.
- Establish both long-term and/or short-term goals.
- Define key performance indicators or metrics.
- Identify potential issues or points of inefficiency.

### Metric 
A metric is a single, quantifiable type of data that can be used for measurement. Data starts as a collection of raw facts, until we organize them into individual metrics that represent a single type of data. Metrics can also be combined into formulas that you can plug your numerical data into. Data contains a lot of raw details about the problem we're exploring. But we need the right metrics to get the answers we're looking for.

Different industries use all kinds of different metrics. But there's one thing they all have in common: they're all trying to meet a specific goal by measuring data.

Using key performance indicators to measure revenue and using annual profit targets to set and evaluate goals are examples of using metrics.

### Metric Goal
A measurable goal set by a company and evaluated using metrics.

**Mathematical thinking**: It means looking at a problem and logically breaking it down step-by-step, so you can see the relationship of patterns in your data, and use that to analyze your problem. This kind of thinking can also help you figure out the best tools for analysis because it lets us see the different aspects of a problem and choose the best logical approach.

### Small data
These kinds of data tend to be made up of datasets concerned with *specific metrics over a short, well defined period of time*. Small data can be useful for making day-to-day decisions, like deciding to drink more water. But it doesn't have a huge impact on bigger frameworks like business operations. <br>

Example: The amount of exercise time it takes for a single person to burn a minimum of 400 calories is a problem that requires small data. It contains a specific metric (400 calories) and a short, defined period of time (amount of exercise time).

### Big data
Big data has *larger, less specific datasets covering a longer period of time*. They usually have to be broken down to be analyzed. Big data is useful for looking at large- scale questions and problems, and they help companies make *big decisions*.

Some challenges you might face when working with big data:
- A lot of organizations deal with data overload and way too much unimportant or irrelevant information. 
- Important data can be hidden deep down with all of the non-important data, which makes it harder to find and use. This can lead to slower and more inefficient decision-making time frames.
- The data you need isn’t always easily accessible. 
- Current technology tools and solutions still struggle to provide measurable and reportable data. This can lead to unfair algorithmic bias. 
- There are gaps in many big data business solutions.

Some benefits that come with big data:
- When large amounts of data can be stored and analyzed, it can help companies identify more efficient ways of doing business and save a lot of time and money.
- Big data helps organizations spot the trends of customer buying patterns and satisfaction levels, which can help them create new products and solutions that will make customers happy.
- By analyzing big data, businesses get a much better understanding of current market conditions, which can help them stay ahead of the competition.
- Big data helps companies keep track of their online presence—especially feedback, both good and bad, from customers. This gives them the information they need to improve and protect their brand.

#### V words for big data
- **Volume** describes the amount of data.
- **Variety** describes the different kinds of data. 
- **Velocity** describes how fast the data can be processed.
- **Veracity** refers to the quality and reliability of the data.

These are all important considerations related to processing huge, complex data sets.
