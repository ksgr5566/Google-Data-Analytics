### Data-inspired decision making
Explores different data sources to find out what they have in common.

#### Algorithm
An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed for a specific task.

The goal of all data analysts is to use data to draw accurate conclusions and make good recommendations. That all starts with having complete, correct, and relevant data. It is possible to have solid data and still make the wrong choices. It is up to data analysts to interpret the data accurately. When data is interpreted incorrectly, it can lead to huge losses. When data is used strategically, businesses can transform and grow their revenue. There is a difference between making a decision with incomplete data and making a decision with a small amount of data. Making a decision with incomplete data is dangerous. But sometimes accurate data from a small test can help you make a good decision.

There are a lot of different kinds of questions that data might help us answer, and these different questions make different kinds of data.

### Quantitative data
Quantitative data is all about the specific and objective measures of numerical facts. This can often be the *what*, *how many*, and *how often* about a problem. In other words, things you can measure, such as a number, quantity or range.

### Qualitative data
Qualitative data is a subjective and explanatory measure of a quality or characteristic. Basically, the things that can't be measured with numerical data, like your hair color. Qualitative data is great for helping us answer *why* questions.

With quantitative data, we can see numbers visualized as charts or graphs. Qualitative data can then give us a more high-level understanding of why the numbers are the way they are. It helps us add context to a problem.

Data analysts will generally use both types of data in their work. Usually, qualitative data can help analysts better understand their quantitative data by providing a reason or more thorough explanation. In other words, quantitative data generally gives you the what, and qualitative data generally gives you the why.

Two data presentation tools:

### Reports
A report is a static collection of data given to stakeholders periodically. <br> <br>
Pros:
- Reports are great for giving snapshots of **high level historical data** for an organization.
- They can be designed and sent out periodically, often on a weekly or monthly basis, as organized and easy to reference information. They're **quick to design and easy to use** as long as you continually maintain them.
- Since reports use static data or data that doesn't change once it's been recorded, they reflect data that's already been **cleaned and sorted**. <br> 

Cons:
- Reports need **regular maintenance**.
- They are **less visually appealing**.
- Because they aren't automatic or dynamic (**static**), reports don't show live, evolving data. <br> <br>

One way spreadsheet data could be visualized in a report:
#### Pivot Table
A data summarization tool that is used in data processing. Pivot tables are used to summarize, sort, re-organize, group, count, total, or average data stored in a database. It allows its users to transform columns into rows and rows into columns. <br> <br>

### Dashboard
Monitors live, incoming data. <br> <br>
Pros:
- **Dynamic, automatic and interactive**: They give your team more access to information being recorded, you can interact through data by playing with filters, and because they're dynamic, they have long-term value.
- **More stakeholder access** and **Low maintenance**: If stakeholders need to continually access information, a dashboard can be more efficient than having to pull reports over and over. <br>

Cons:
- **Labor-intensive design**: They take a lot of time to design and can actually be less efficient than reports, if they're not used very often.
- **Can be confusing**: If the base table breaks at any point, they need a lot of maintenance to get back up and running again.
- **Potentially uncleaned data**: Dashboards can sometimes overwhelm people with information too. If you aren't used to looking through data on a dashboard, you might get lost in it. <br> 

A dashboard would be useful for monitoring data as it becomes available. You might create a Tableau dashboard with interactive graphs that showcase multiple views of the data.

### Metric 
A metric is a single, quantifiable type of data that can be used for measurement. Data starts as a collection of raw facts, until we organize them into individual metrics that represent a single type of data. Metrics can also be combined into formulas that you can plug your numerical data into. Data contains a lot of raw details about the problem we're exploring. But we need the right metrics to get the answers we're looking for.

Different industries use all kinds of different metrics. But there's one thing they all have in common: they're all trying to meet a specific goal by measuring data.

### Metric Goal
A measurable goal set by a company and evaluated using metrics.
