By asking yourself a few simple questions at the beginning of each task, you can ensure that you're able to stay focused on your objective while still balancing stakeholder needs.
You could be working on multiple projects with lots of different people but no matter what project you're working on, there are three things you can focus on that will help you stay on task.
1. Who are the primary and secondary stakeholders? 
2. Who is managing the data? 
3. Where can you go for help?
