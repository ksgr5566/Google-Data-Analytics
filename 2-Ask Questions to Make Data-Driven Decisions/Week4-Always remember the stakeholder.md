Focusing on stakeholder expectations will help you understand the goal of a project, communicate more effectively across your team, and build trust in your work.

By asking yourself a few simple questions at the beginning of each task, you can ensure that you're able to stay focused on your objective while still balancing stakeholder needs.
You could be working on multiple projects with lots of different people but no matter what project you're working on, there are three things you can focus on that will help you stay on task.
1. Who are the primary and secondary stakeholders? 
2. Who is managing the data? 
3. Where can you go for help?

- There are four key questions data analysts ask themselves to communicate clearly with stakeholders and team members
  1. Who your audience is 
  2. What they already know 
  3. What they need to know 
  4. How you can communicate that effectively to them

  You'll want your emails to be just as professional as your in-person communications.

- It's important to set realistic expectations at every stage of the project. Setting expectations for a realistic timeline might involve sharing a high-level schedule with stakeholders, creating a schedule, and communicating clearly with team members.

- In the data world, speed can sometimes be the enemy of accuracy, especially when collaboration is required.

- A data analyst reframes a question. Then, they outline the problem, challenges, potential solutions, and timeframe in order to put data into context, balance speed with accuracy, and keep stakeholders informed. (To ensure their work answers the right questions and delivers useful results, the data analyst should set clear expectations, outline the problem, and reframe the question)

- Focusing on stakeholder expectations enables data analysts to understand project goals, improve communication, and build trust.

- Asking questions including, “Does my analysis answer the original question?” and “Are there other angles I haven’t considered?” enable data analysts to consider the best ways to share data with others, help their team make informed decisions, and use data to get to a solid conclusion.

- Data analysts pay attention to sample size in order to represent a diverse set of perspectives and avoid skewed results or inaccurate judgements.

- When leading a meeting, testing out technology, taking notes and preparing supporting materials will help you ensure all participants have a positive experience.

**Before the meeting**
- If you are organizing the meeting, you will probably talk about the data. Before the meeting: 
- Identify your objective. Establish the purpose, goals, and desired outcomes of the meeting, including any questions or requests that need to be addressed.
- Acknowledge participants and keep them involved with different points of view and experiences with the data, the project, or the business.
- Organize the data to be presented. You might need to turn raw data into accessible formats or create data visualizations. 
- Prepare and distribute an agenda. We will go over this next.

**Crafting a compelling agenda**

A solid meeting agenda sets your meeting up for success. Here are the basic parts your agenda should include: 
- Meeting start and end time
- Meeting location (including information to participate remotely, if that option is available)
- Objectives 
- Background material or data the participants should review beforehand

Sharing your agenda ahead of time

**During the meeting**

As the leader of the meeting, it's your job to guide the data discussion. With everyone well informed of the meeting plan and goals, you can follow these steps to avoid any distractions:
- Make introductions (if necessary) and review key messages
- Present the data 
- Discuss observations, interpretations, and implications of the data
- Take notes during the meeting
- Determine and summarize next steps for the group 

**After the meeting**
- Distribute any notes or data 
- Confirm next steps and timeline for additional actions
- Ask for feedback (this is an effective way to figure out if you missed anything in your recap)

To shift a situation from problematic to productive, data analysts can reframe a problem and start a constructive conversation. This will give everyone the chance to share their viewpoints in a productive manner which leads to a more successful project.
