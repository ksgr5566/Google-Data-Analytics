Focusing on stakeholder expectations will help you understand the goal of a project, communicate more effectively across your team, and build trust in your work.

By asking yourself a few simple questions at the beginning of each task, you can ensure that you're able to stay focused on your objective while still balancing stakeholder needs.
You could be working on multiple projects with lots of different people but no matter what project you're working on, there are three things you can focus on that will help you stay on task.
1. Who are the primary and secondary stakeholders? 
2. Who is managing the data? 
3. Where can you go for help?

- Before you communicate, think about
  1. Who your audience is 
  2. What they already know 
  3. What they need to know 
  4. How you can communicate that effectively to them

  You'll want your emails to be just as professional as your in-person communications.

- It's important to set realistic expectations at every stage of the project. Setting expectations for a realistic timeline might involve sharing a high-level schedule with stakeholders, creating a schedule, and communicating clearly with team members.

- In the data world, speed can sometimes be the enemy of accuracy, especially when collaboration is required.

- A data analyst reframes a question. Then, they outline the problem, challenges, potential solutions, and timeframe in order to put data into context, balance speed with accuracy, and keep stakeholders informed. (To ensure their work answers the right questions and delivers useful results, the data analyst should set clear expectations, outline the problem, and reframe the question)

- Focusing on stakeholder expectations enables data analysts to understand project goals, improve communication, and build trust.

- Asking questions including, “Does my analysis answer the original question?” and “Are there other angles I haven’t considered?” enable data analysts to consider the best ways to share data with others, help their team make informed decisions, and use data to get to a solid conclusion.
