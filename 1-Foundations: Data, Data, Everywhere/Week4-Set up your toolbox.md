### Spreadsheet basics

- Each rectangular block is a cell.
- Each cell is meant for one data point.
- Cells are organized by columns and rows.
- Each column has a distinct letter, and each row has a distinct number. 
- Each cell has a unique identifier composed of the column letter and row number. This identifier is like the cell’s address.

- Adding labels to the top of the columns will make it easier to reference and find data later on when you're doing analysis. These column labels are usually called attributes. An **attribute** is a characteristic or quality of data used to label a column in a table. More commonly, attributes are referred to as column names, column labels, headers, or the header row.
- In a dataset, a row is also called an observation. An **observation** includes all of the attributes for what is contained in a row of a data table.

A spreadsheet helps you structure data in rows and columns, prepare data for analysis, and create custom data visualizations. To better analyze your data, you clean up your chart to make it more visually appealing and to clarify what data means by making your chart more descriptive. To do that, it’s important to add chart titles and axis titles.
