Data analytics helps businesses make better decisions, but getting there is a process. It begins with analyzing a business problem, identifying data about that problem, and then using data analysis to arrive at an answer. Sometimes you get an answer that solves your business problem, but itâ€™s often just as likely that you discover other questions to investigate further.

Businesses using data analytics have a common theme. They all have issues to explore, questions to answer, or problems to solve.
- An **issue** is a topic or subject to investigate.
- A **question** is designed to discover information.
- A **problem** is an obstacle or complication that needs to be worked out.

These questions and problems become the foundation for all kinds of business tasks, that you'll help solve as a data analyst. A **business task** is the question or problem data analysis answers for a business. Data analytics helps businesses make better decisions. It all starts with a business task and the question it's trying to answer.

Data analysts have an important responsibility: making sure that their analyses are fair (ensuring that analysis does not create or reinforce bias requires using processes and systems that are fair and inclusive to everyone). **Fairness** means ensuring that your analysis doesn't create or reinforce bias. It's important to think about fairness from the moment you start collecting data for a business task to the time you present your conclusions to your stakeholders.
