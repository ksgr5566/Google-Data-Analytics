Data analytics helps businesses make better decisions, but getting there is a process. It begins with analyzing a business problem, identifying data about that problem, and then using data analysis to arrive at an answer. Sometimes you get an answer that solves your business problem, but it’s often just as likely that you discover other questions to investigate further.

Businesses using data analytics have a common theme. They all have issues to explore, questions to answer, or problems to solve.
- An **issue** is a topic or subject to investigate.
- A **question** is designed to discover information.
- A **problem** is an obstacle or complication that needs to be worked out.

These questions and problems become the foundation for all kinds of business tasks, that you'll help solve as a data analyst. A **business task** is the question or problem data analysis answers for a business. Data analytics helps businesses make better decisions. It all starts with a business task and the question it's trying to answer.

Data analysts have an important responsibility: making sure that their analyses are fair (ensuring that analysis does not create or reinforce bias requires using processes and systems that are fair and inclusive to everyone). **Fairness** means ensuring that your analysis doesn't create or reinforce bias. It's important to think about fairness from the moment you start collecting data for a business task to the time you present your conclusions to your stakeholders.

#### A case study:
1. To improve the effectiveness of its teaching staff, the administration of a high school offered the opportunity for all teachers to participate in a workshop. They were not required to attend; instead, the administration encouraged teachers to sign up. Of the 43 teachers on staff, 19 chose to take the workshop. <br />
At the end of the academic year, the administration collected data on teacher performance for all teachers on staff. The data was collected via student survey. In the survey, students were asked to rank each teacher's effectiveness on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 6 (very good). <br />
The administration compared data on teachers who attended the workshop to data on teachers who did not. The comparison revealed that teachers who attended the workshop had an average score of 4.95, while teachers who did not attend had an average score of 4.22. The administration concluded that the workshop was a success.
- This is an example of unfair practice. It is tempting to conclude—as the administration did—that the workshop was a success. However, since the workshop was voluntary and not random, it is not appropriate to infer a causal relationship between attending the workshop and the higher rating. <br />
The workshop might have been effective, but other explanations for the differences in the ratings cannot be ruled out. For example, another explanation could be that the staff volunteering for the workshop were the better, more motivated teachers. This group of teachers would be rated higher whether or not the workshop was effective. <br />
It’s also notable that there is no direct connection between student survey responses and workshop attendance. The data analyst could correct this by asking for the teachers to be selected randomly to participate in the workshop. They could also collect data that measures something more directly related to workshop attendance, such as the success of a technique the teachers learned in that workshop.
