Our brains are biologically designed to streamline thinking and make quick judgments.
#### Bias
A preference in favor of or against a person, group of people, or thing. It can be conscious or subconscious. Once we know and accept that we have bias, we can start to recognize our own patterns of thinking and learn how to manage it.
#### Data Bias
A type of error that systematically skews results in a certain direction.
- **Sampling bias**: When a sample isn't representative of the population as a whole. You can avoid this by making sure the sample is chosen at random, so that all parts of the population have an equal chance of being included. **Unbiased sampling** results in a sample that's representative of the population being measured. Another great way to discover if you're working with unbiased data is to bring the results to life with visualizations. This will help you easily identify any misalignment with your sample.
- **Observer bias**(experimenter bias/research bias): The tendency for different people to observe things differently.
- **Interpretation bias**: The tendency to always interpret ambiguous situations in a positive, or negative way.
- **Confirmation bias**: The tendency to search for, or interpret information in a way that confirms preexisting beliefs.

How we can go about finding and identifying good data sources: **Reliable**(Good data sources are reliable), **Original**(To make sure you're dealing with good data, be sure to validate it with the original source), **Comprehensive**(The best data sources contain all critical information needed to answer the question or find the solution), **Current**(The best data sources are current and relevant to the task at hand), **Cited**(Citing makes the information you're providing more credible). Every good solution is found by avoiding bad data. For good data, stick with vetted public data sets, academic papers, financial data and governmental agency data.

 #### Data anonymization
 **Personally identifiable information**, or PII, is information that can be used by itself or with other data to track down a person's identity. Data anonymization is the process of protecting people's private or sensitive data by eliminating that kind of information. Typically, data anonymization involves blanking, hashing, or masking personal information, often by using fixed-length codes to represent data columns, or hiding data with altered values. <br> **De-identification** is a process used to wipe data clean of all personally identifying information.
