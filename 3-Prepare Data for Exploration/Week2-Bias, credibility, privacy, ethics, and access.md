Our brains are biologically designed to streamline thinking and make quick judgments.
#### Bias
A preference in favor of or against a person, group of people, or thing. It can be conscious or subconscious. Once we know and accept that we have bias, we can start to recognize our own patterns of thinking and learn how to manage it.
#### Data Bias
A type of error that systematically skews results in a certain direction.
- **Sampling bias**: When a sample isn't representative of the population as a whole. You can avoid this by making sure the sample is chosen at random, so that all parts of the population have an equal chance of being included. **Unbiased sampling** results in a sample that's representative of the population being measured. Another great way to discover if you're working with unbiased data is to bring the results to life with visualizations. This will help you easily identify any misalignment with your sample.
- **Observer bias**(experimenter bias/research bias): The tendency for different people to observe things differently.
- **Interpretation bias**: The tendency to always interpret ambiguous situations in a positive, or negative way.
- **Confirmation bias**: The tendency to search for, or interpret information in a way that confirms preexisting beliefs.
