### How data is collected
- Interviews, Observations(most often used by scientists), Forms, Questionnaires, Surveys, Cookies.

### Data collection considerations 
- How the data will be collected
  - Decide if you will collect the data using your own resources or receive (and possibly purchase it) from another party.
- Choose the data sources
  - **First-party data**: Data collected by an individual or group using their own resources. Collecting first-party data is typically the preferred method because you know exactly where it came from.
  - **Second-party data**: Data collected by a group directly from its audience and then sold.
  - **Third-party data**: Data collected from outside sources who did not collect it directly. This data might have come from a number of different sources before you investigated it. It might not be as reliable, but that doesn't mean it can't be useful.
  
  No matter what kind of data you use, it needs to be inspected for accuracy, bias, and credibility.
- Decide what data to use
  - Choosing the data that can help you find answers and solve problems and not getting distracted by other data.
- How much data to collect
  - A **population** refers to all possible data values in a certain data set.
  - In instances when collecting data from an entire population is challenging, data analysts may choose to use a sample. A **sample** is a part of a population that is representative of that population. 
- Select the right data type
- Determine the time frame
  - If you are collecting your own data, decide how long you will need to collect it, especially if you are tracking trends over a long period of time. If you need an immediate answer, you might not have time to collect new data. In this case, you would need to use historical data that already exists.
