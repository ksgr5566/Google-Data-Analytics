### How data is collected
- Interviews, Observations(most often used by scientists), Forms, Questionnaires, Surveys, Cookies.

### Data collection considerations 
- How the data will be collected
  - Decide if you will collect the data using your own resources or receive (and possibly purchase it) from another party.
- Choose the data sources
  - **First-party data**: Data collected by an individual or group using their own resources. Collecting first-party data is typically the preferred method because you know exactly where it came from.
  - **Second-party data**: Data collected by a group directly from its audience and then sold.
  - **Third-party data**: Data collected from outside sources who did not collect it directly. This data might have come from a number of different sources before you investigated it. It might not be as reliable, but that doesn't mean it can't be useful.
  
  No matter what kind of data you use, it needs to be inspected for accuracy, bias, and credibility.
- Decide what data to use
  - Choosing the data that can help you find answers and solve problems and not getting distracted by other data.
- How much data to collect
  - A **population** refers to all possible data values in a certain data set.
  - In instances when collecting data from an entire population is challenging, data analysts may choose to use a sample. A **sample** is a part of a population that is representative of that population. 
- Select the right data type
- Determine the time frame
  - If you are collecting your own data, decide how long you will need to collect it, especially if you are tracking trends over a long period of time. If you need an immediate answer, you might not have time to collect new data. In this case, you would need to use historical data that already exists.

### Data modeling

<strong>Data modeling</strong> is the process of creating diagrams that visually represent how data is organized and structured. These visual representations are called data models. You can think of data modeling as a blueprint of a house. At any point, there might be electricians, carpenters, and plumbers using that blueprint. Each one of these builders has a different relationship to the blueprint, but they all need it to understand the overall structure of the house. Data models are similar; different users might have different data needs, but the data model gives them an understanding of the structure as a whole. 

Data model is a model that is used for organizing data elements and how they relate to one another. **Data elements** are pieces of information, such as people's names, account numbers, and addresses. Data models help to keep data consistent and provide a map of how data is organized. This makes it easier for analysts and other stakeholders to make sense of their data and use it for business purposes.

<details>
  <summary>Each level of data modeling has a different level of detail.</summary>
  <ol><li><strong>Conceptual data modeling</strong> gives a high-level view of the data structure, such as how data interacts across an organization. For example, a conceptual data model may be used to define the business requirements for a new database. A conceptual data model doesn't contain technical details.</li>

<li><strong>Logical data modeling</strong> focuses on the technical details of a database such as relationships, attributes, and entities. For example, a logical data model defines how individual records are uniquely identified in a database. But it doesn't spell out actual names of database tables. That's the job of a physical data model.</li>

<li><strong>Physical data modeling</strong> depicts how a database operates. A physical data model defines all entities and attributes used; for example, it includes table names, column names, and data types for the database.</li></ol>
</details>

<details><summary>Data-modeling techniques</summary>There are a lot of approaches when it comes to developing data models, but two common methods are the <strong>Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)</strong> and the <strong>Unified Modeling Language (UML)</strong> diagram. ERDs are a visual way to understand the relationship between entities in the data model. UML diagrams are very detailed diagrams that describe the structure of a system by showing the system's entities, attributes, operations, and their relationships. As a junior data analyst, you will need to understand that there are different data modeling techniques, but in practice, you will probably be using your organization’s existing technique.</details> <br>

Data modeling can help you explore the high-level details of your data and how it is related across the organization’s information systems. Data modeling sometimes requires data analysis to understand how the data is put together; that way, you know how to map the data. And finally, data models make it easier for everyone in your organization to understand and collaborate with you on your data.

### Data type 
A specific kind of data attribute that tells what kind of value the data is. <br>Data types can be different depending on the query language you're using. For example, SQL allows for different data types depending on which database you're using.

Data types in spreadsheets: Number, Text or String, and Boolean.

<br>

A data table, or tabular data, has a very simple structure. It's arranged in rows and columns. You can call the rows **records** and the columns **fields**. They basically mean the same thing, but records and fields can be used for any kind of data table, while rows and columns are usually reserved for spreadsheets. Sometimes a **field** can also refer to a single piece of data, like the value in a cell.

### Wide data
Data in which every data subject has a single row with multiple columns to hold the values of various attributes of the subject. Wide data lets you easily identify and quickly compare different columns. Wide data is preferred when:
- Creating tables and charts with a few variables about each subject.
- Comparing straightforward line graphs.

### Long data
Data in which each row is one time point per subject, so each subject will have data in multiple rows. Long data is a great format for storing and organizing data when there's multiple variables for each subject at each time point that we want to observe. Long data is preferred when:
- Storing a lot of variables about each subject. For example, 60 years worth of interest rates for each bank.
- Performing advanced statistical analysis or graphing.

### Data transformation
Data transformation is the process of changing the data’s format, structure, or values.
<details><summary>Data transformation usually involves:</summary><ul>
  <li>Adding, copying, or replicating data</li>
  <li>Deleting fields or records</li>
  <li>Standardizing the names of variables</li>
  <li>Renaming, moving, or combining columns in a database</li>
  <li>Joining one set of data with another</li>
  <li>Saving a file in a different format. For example, saving a spreadsheet as a comma separated values (CSV) file</li></ul>
</details>

Goals for data transformation might be:
- Data **organization**: better organized data is easier to use
- Data **compatibility**: different applications or systems can then use the same data
- Data **migration**: data with matching formats can be moved from one system to another
- Data **merging**: data with the same organization can be merged together
- Data **enhancement**: data can be displayed with more detailed fields 
- Data **comparison**: apples-to-apples comparisons of the data can then be made
