Best practices when organizing data:
- Naming conventions: These are consistent guidelines that describe the content, date, or version of a file in its name. Basically, this means you want to use logical and descriptive names for your files to make them easier to find and use. Naming conventions help us organize, access, process, and analyze our data.
- Foldering: Organizing your files into folders helps keep project-related files together in one place
- Archiving older files: Move old projects to a separate location to create an archive and cut down on clutter.
- Align your naming and storage practices with your team to avoid any confusion.
- Develop metadata practices: Your team might also develop metadata practices like creating a file that outlines project naming conventions for easy reference.

A data analytics team uses metadata to indicate consistent naming conventions for a project.

File naming recommendations:
- Work out and agree on file naming conventions early on in a project to avoid renaming files again and again.
- Align your file naming with your team's or company's existing file-naming conventions.
- Ensure that your file names are meaningful; consider including information like project name and anything else that will help you quickly identify (and use) the file for the right purpose.
- Include the date and version number in file names; common formats are YYYYMMDD for dates and v## for versions (or revisions).
- Create a text file as a sample file with content that describes (breaks down) the file naming convention and a file name that applies it.
- Avoid spaces and special characters in file names. Instead, use dashes, underscores, or capital letters. Spaces and special characters can cause errors in some applications.

Good file organization includes making it easy to find current, related files that are backed up regularly.

#### Data security
Protecting data from unauthorized access or corruption by adopting safety measures.

Google sheets and excel have features to:
- Protect spreadsheets from being edited
- Control access like password protection and user permissions
- Tabs can also be hidden and unhidden in Sheets and Excel, allowing you to change what data is being viewed. But even hidden tabs can be unhidden by someone else, so be sure you're okay with those tabs still being accessible.

When using data security measures, analysts can choose between protecting an entire spreadsheet or protecting certain cells within the spreadsheet. Data security can be used to protect an entire spreadsheet, specific parts of a spreadsheet, or even just a single cell. Data analysts use encryption and sharing permissions to control who can access or edit a spreadsheet.

Some data security options:
- **Encryption** uses a unique algorithm to alter data and make it unusable by users and applications that don’t know the algorithm. This algorithm is saved as a “key” which can be used to reverse the encryption; so if you have the key, you can still use the data in its original form.  
- **Tokenization** replaces the data elements you want to protect with randomly generated data referred to as a “token.” The original data is stored in a separate location and mapped to the tokens. To access the complete original data, the user or application needs to have permission to use the tokenized data and the token mapping. This means that even if the tokenized data is hacked, the original data is still safe and secure in a separate location.
